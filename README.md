## üîç Overview

This mini-project simplifies one of the foundational tasks in cybersecurity: network reconnaissance. It leverages the power of **Nmap** integrated with a **Bash script** to automate basic scans on a target system or domain. The tool is designed to assist beginners in understanding practical network scanning operations.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand and utilize basic Nmap functions such as Ping Scans, Port Scans, and OS Detection.
- Learn to automate reconnaissance using Bash scripting.
- Build a reusable command-line script that stores scan outputs for documentation and analysis.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Nmap** ‚Äì Network scanning tool
- **Bash (Linux)** ‚Äì Scripting language used for automation
- **Kali Linux** ‚Äì Operating system used for testing
- **GitHub** ‚Äì For version control and open-source sharing (optional)

## üìÅ Folder Structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scan.sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ results/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ targetname_scan.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
[**Consider adding a brief explanation of each file/folder if needed.** For example:

-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
-   `scan.sh`: The Bash script responsible for running Nmap scans.
-   `results/`: Directory where scan output files are saved.
-   `LICENSE`: Contains the licensing information for the project. ]

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

[**Provide instructions on how to get the script running.** This might involve:]

1.  **Cloning the repository (if you're using GitHub):**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Repository Name]
    ```
    [**Replace `[Your Repository URL]` and `[Repository Name]` with your actual repository details if you are using GitHub.**]
2.  **Ensuring Nmap is installed:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nmap
    ```
3.  **Making the Bash script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x scan.sh
    ```
    [**Note that I've changed `script/network_scanner.sh` to `scan.sh` to match your folder structure.**]

[**Adjust these steps based on your actual setup and requirements.**]
